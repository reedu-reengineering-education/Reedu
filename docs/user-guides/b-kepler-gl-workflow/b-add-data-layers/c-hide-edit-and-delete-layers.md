# Hide, Edit and Delete Layers

Each layer has its own tab in the **Data Layers** menu:
![Hide, edit and delete layers](https://d1a3f4spazzrp4.cloudfront.net/kepler.gl/documentation/image8.png 'Hide, edit and delete layers')

Click the **down arrow** to open up the settings menu for that layer. Click the **trashcan** to delete a layer. Click the **eye** to toggle show/hide.

**Note**: The colored line on the left of each layer tab represents what dataset that layer belongs to.
